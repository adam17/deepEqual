# deepEqual

Write a function *deepEqual* that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.


Lesson I have learned (from MDN):

> There is no way to stop or break a **forEach()** loop other than by throwing an exception. If you need such behavior, the **forEach()** method is the wrong tool.
